# üß† Employee Turnover Prediction

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alkoj/ala-k-mod1-atsiskaitymas/blob/main/Employee_turnover.ipynb)

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to predict employee turnover to help organizations retain valuable employees. By analyzing factors that influence employee satisfaction and retention, the model identifies key indicators that can guide management strategies, improve work conditions, and ultimately reduce employee attrition.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features for each employee:

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `satisfaction_level`   | Employee satisfaction level (0 to 1)                                        |
| `last_evaluation`      | Last performance evaluation score                                           |
| `number_project`       | Number of projects the employee has worked on                               |
| `average_monthly_hours`| Average hours worked per month                                              |
| `time_spend_company`   | Number of years spent in the company                                        |
| `work_accident`        | Whether the employee had a work accident (0 = No, 1 = Yes)                  |
| `promotion_last_5years`| Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years (0 = No, 1 = Yes)     |
| `department`           | Department the employee belongs to                                          |
| `salary`               | Salary category (low, medium, high)                                         |
| `left`                 | Target variable: whether the employee left (1 = Yes, 0 = No)                |

## üßπ Data Processing

- Missing value checks
- Encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Data splitting (train/test)

## ü§ñ Machine Learning

Various classification algorithms were tested and compared to predict employee attrition. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used for evaluation.
